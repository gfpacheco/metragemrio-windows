Metragem Rio is a project by [Heloisa Simon](https://github.com/heloisasim). Its goal is to alert people living on the surroundings of the Itajaí-Açu river about the status of the river, that every year floods the the towns on it's course.

The whole project consists of a server that capture the river's metrics from public sources and offers these data in form of an API.
And client apps, for the three major mobile systems.

This code is only for the Windows Phone client app, which was developed by me.

The other parts were developed by:

- Server: [João Ricardo](https://github.com/joaoricardo000)
- Android app: [Heloisa Simon](https://github.com/heloisasim)
- iOS app: [Glauco Neves](https://github.com/glauconeves)
